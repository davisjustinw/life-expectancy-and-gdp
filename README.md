# Life Expectency and GDP
For this project I analysed World Health Organization and World Bank data provided by Codecademy for the purpose of the project.  The data contained GDP and life expectency data for the following countries between 2000 and 2015:

- Chile 
- China
- Germany 
- Mexico 
- United States of America
- Zimbabwe

The listed countries represent a diversity of economies from the massive econimies that are the United States and China to the relatively small Zimbabwe.

## Interesting Events
I found it interesting to to see world events reflected in GDP and life expectency.  From the world financial crisis of 2008-9, to the H1N1 outbreak in South America to reditribution of farm land in Zimbabwe.

### Each Country Had Their Own Life Expectency Story
The strongest lesson in the data I found was how when all the data for all the countries was lumped together there was no distinct correlation between GDP and life expectency.  However within the economic realities of each country there was a postive relationship between GDP and life expectency.  Said another way a given gdp does not predict a given life expectency when looking at the world as a whole.  There are other factors in those countries affecting life expectency.
